Conclusions and future work
*******************************************************************************

We have provided a brief review of the technology leading up to an effective rendering of the mobile process calculi as a programming model and execution engine for decentralized networks of programmable VMs. We have described a step by step procedure for realizing this on a blockchain in which the state of the VMs are stored.We have provided the background and design rationale for this approach as a correct-by-construction architecture of a blockchain based public, economic, compute infrastructure.
